It is a define-by-run framework, which means that your backprop is\n","defined by how your code is run, and that every single iteration can be\n","different.\n","\n","Let us see this in more simple terms with some examples.\n","\n","Tensor\n","--------\n","\n","``torch.Tensor`` is the central class of the package. If you set its attribute\n","``.requires_grad`` as ``True``, it starts to track all operations on it. When\n","you finish your computation you can call ``.backward()`` and have all the\n","gradients computed automatically. The gradient for this tensor will be\n","accumulated into ``.grad`` attribute.\n","\n","To stop a tensor from tracking history, you can call ``.detach()`` to detach\n","it from the computation history, and to prevent future computation from being\n","tracked.\n","\n","To prevent tracking history (and using memory), you can also wrap the code block\n","in ``with torch.no_grad():``. This can be particularly helpful when evaluating a\n","model because the model may have trainable parameters with\n","``requires_grad=True``, but for which we don't need the gradients.\n","\n","There’s one more class which is very important for autograd\n","implementation - a ``Function``.\n","\n","``Tensor`` and ``Function`` are interconnected and build up an acyclic\n","graph, that encodes a complete history of computation. Each tensor has\n","a ``.grad_fn`` attribute that references a ``Function`` that has created\n","the ``Tensor`` (except for Tensors created by the user - their\n","``grad_fn is None``).\n","\n","If you want to compute the derivatives, you can call ``.backward()`` on\n","a ``Tensor``. If ``Tensor`` is a scalar (i.e. it holds a one element\n","data), you don’t need to specify any arguments to ``backward()``,\n","however if it has more elements, you need to specify a ``gradient``\n","argument that is a tensor of matching shape.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"4fgmGG_h_NqK","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1599187484331,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":4717,"user":{"displayName":"‍김도윤[ 학부재학 / 산업경영공학부 ]","photoUrl":"","userId":"10791284398836833218"}}},"source":["import torch"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bKIH59qN_NqO","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Create a tensor and set ``requires_grad=True`` to track computation with it\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"LANpMN4-_NqO","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":52},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1599187488476,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":1434,"user":{"displayName":"‍김도윤[ 학부재학 / 산업경영공학부 ]","photoUrl":"","userId":"10791284398836833218"}},"outputId":"1ae0034d-704b-4e62-ab6c-ebf5dbfbc0dd"},"source":["x = torch.ones(2, 2, requires_grad=True)\n","print(x)"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["tensor([[1., 1.],\n","        [1., 1.]], requires_grad=True)\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"crVUcopY_NqR","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Do a tensor operation:\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ri5-PUuV_NqR","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":52},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1599187493159,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":1469,"user":{"displayName":"‍김도윤[ 학부재학 / 산업경영공학부 ]","photoUrl":"","userId":"10791284398836833218"}},"outputId":"de902602-be75-486e-9142-070dd1555393"},"source":["y = x + 2\n","print(y)"],"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["tensor([[3., 3.],\n","        [3., 3.]], grad_fn=<AddBackward0>)\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EcUiZuBn_NqU","colab_type":"text"},"source":["``y`` was created as a result of an operation, so it has a ``grad_fn``.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vbUbGUTi_NqU","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1599187498388,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":1409,"user":{"displayName":"‍김도윤[ 학부재학 / 산업경영공학부 ]","photoUrl":"","userId":"10791284398836833218"}},"outputId":"7ea7d698-60ac-4524-8407-48cf5665b012"},"source":["print(y.grad_fn)"],"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["<AddBackward0 object at 0x7f6514ceaa90>\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8XlCYvFu_NqX","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Do more operations on ``y``\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"gz0RmEYB_NqY","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":52},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1599187645642,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":761,"user":{"displayName":"‍김도윤[ 학부재학 / 산업경영공학부 ]","photoUrl":"","userId":"10791284398836833218"}},"outputId":"b5e25ea2-8954-44fe-8b95-cea165864b59"},"source":["z = y * y * 3\n","out = z.mean()\n","\n","print(z, out)"],"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["tensor([[27., 27.],\n","        [27., 27.]], grad_fn=<MulBackward0>) tensor(27., grad_fn=<MeanBackward0>)\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-2X6_ZIG_Nqb","colab_type":"text"},"source":["``.requires_grad_( ... )`` changes an existing Tensor's ``requires_grad``\n","flag in-place.
